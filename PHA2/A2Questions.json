The plane makes an angle θ to the horizontal. The cylinder is released and the time t to fall a distance d is measured. It is suggested that 2d/t^2 = −(A H sinθ)/(A + B) − (A K)/(A + B), where H and K are constants. Plan a laboratory experiment to test the relationship between t and θ. Draw a diagram of the arrangement, explain the procedure, measurements, control of variables, data analysis to determine H and K, and any safety precautions.",

As the turbine blades turn, electricity is generated and the pump pushes liquid through a vertical pipe. The frequency of rotation of the turbine blades is f. The height the liquid moves is h. The mass per unit time of the liquid leaving the top of the pipe is Q. It is suggested that Q is related to f by the relationship Q g h = C + D f^3, where g is the acceleration of free fall, and C and D are constants. Plan a laboratory experiment to test the relationship between Q and f. Draw a diagram showing the arrangement of your equipment. Explain how the results could be used to determine values for C and D. In your plan you should include: the procedure to be followed; the measurements to be taken; the control of variables; the analysis of the data; any safety precautions to be taken.",
